# opencv-tools
My repo for opencv practise.

Goals:
- to create some useful examples on how to use opencv
- to create some cool artistic effects for image processing
- to learn image processing and computer vision

## What

- Load an image
- Adjust the saturation and brightness
- See the histogram change in real time to analyze how the effects affect the color balance

## Installation

- Install dependencies: `opencv`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

## Usage

- `python3 main.py`
